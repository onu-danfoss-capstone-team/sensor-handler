## Hardware

The power and data lines inside the case should be connected and ready to use. If work was done or lines were otherwise disconnected, the female plugs are all labelled for ease of use. The signal conditioners are labeled as well, so ensure all plugs are firmly connected.

The male jumpers for the seven-segment displays are labeled. Should they become disconnected, the following is the pinout:
- VCC: 5V
- GND: Ground
- LOAD: D12
- CLK: D13
- DIN: D11

The plug interfaces between the inside and outside of the case are all labelled, simply plug the thermocouples and pressure sensor into the appropriate plug.

Plugging the data line into the 24V source may cause damage to the component, ensure all connections are correct before powering the system!
